Project Bippos
High-Level Summary
This project is our team's representation of a planet we created where chemosynthetic life thrives by using chemicals found in under water vents inspired by life in the Earth's deep oceans. We based our example of a food pyramid on the inspirations from NASA descriptions of watery worlds and deep sea life that runs without access to sunlight here on Earth.

Project Details
Our project demonstrates a possible planet in another solar system that could contain chemosynthetic life. We hope that this project will inspire astrobiologists to consider different ways to look at life on other planets.

Our project gives an example of a simplified ecosystem based around chemosynthesis made possible by hydrothermal vents. The combination of text and images engages and inspires people to consider what's possible.

This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted on GitHub. The 3D animated models of our organisms and world were made using dotbigbang.com.
