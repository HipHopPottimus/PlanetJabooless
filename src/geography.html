        <p>
            The planet Jabooless is the 7th planet from the sun in the capronous system, so the surface water instantly freezes.
            Thanks to the hot vents, the ice at the bottom of the seas melted allowing life to thrive in the harsh conditions.
            This planetâ€™s crust is filled with cracks because the planet is near an asteroid belt and off shoots from that constantly slam into the surface.
