            The project brief was to imagine a planet that thrived on chemosynthetic life and we succeeded in doing so by creating project Jabooless: a complete ecosystem based on those simple principles. Our planet has many cracks on the sea floor to allow the right chemicals to flood up from the crust to help bacteria survive and from there the food triangle continues to apex predators.
